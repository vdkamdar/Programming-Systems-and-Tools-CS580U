# Programming-Systems-and-Tools-CS580U
My Classwork solutions for Programming Systems and Tools (CS580U) 

**Program1: Revisiting basic C concepts**

-Variables and arithematic
-Data types and type casting
-Functions and recursion

**Program2: Unix Tools and Bits**

-GDB
-Bash Scripting
-Bit shifting
-Makefiles

**Program3: Strings and IO**

-String Manipulations
-File IO

**Program4: Arrays, Structs and Pointers**

-Tournament Scheduling Simulator using single elimination
-Performs various validation checks
-Optional Handicap mechanism

**Program5: ADT Dynamic Arrays**

-Dynamic array data structure, Vector
-Supporting operations on the vector: Initialize, Insert, Delete, Read
-Insert supports two internal implementations:
	1.Increment array size using Geometric exapansion
	2.Increment array size by 1.5 times
	Compare efficiency of both the implementations
-Delete supports two internal implementations:
	1. Alter the original(data) array
	2. Keep track of valid indexes of data array in other array and alter index array.

**Program6: ADT Lists**

-Doubly Linked List using list and node structures
-Supporting operations on the doubly linked list: 
Create, Insert, Delete, Read, Empty, SearchForward, SearchBackward

-Stack as a wrapper for linked list
-Supporting operations on  the stack: push, pop

-Queue as a wrapper for linked list
-Supporting operations on the queue: enqueue, dequeue

**Program7: Binary Search Trees**

Binary Search Tree
-Supporting operations on the BST: 
Insert, Search, Remove data(leaf, shortCircuit, promotion), Sort, Comapare, Clone, Delete tree

**Program8: Building a Heap**

-Min-Heap
-Supporting operations on the min-heap:
Initialize, Remove priority, Siftdown, Heapify
